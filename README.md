# Cloud_Computing_Project

This is a cloud computing project, where we developed an web application app with angular framework for frontend and flask for backend. 
The backend applications are included in the "Microservice" folder. The finalFlaskCodeCombination folder involves the eventual backend applicaiton 
file, and there is also a google-login-folder that implements google authorization. The UI folder contains "app" folder, which could be used to replace 
the app folder of an angular framework. If you are not familiar with angular, just replace the app folder in my "F22_Simple_UI" repo with this app, and 
it creates a frontend UI. Finally, there is another login_app, which is really similar to the app folder in UI folder, and it works separately 
as our login page, you could do similar stuff like replacing the app folder in my previous repo with this app to set up our login page. 

This process should make you run our web locally, and another big part of our project is deploying these local codes into AWS and form a solid architecture.
